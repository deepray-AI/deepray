"""
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) let us generate novel image data, video data,
or audio data from a random input. Typically, the random input is sampled
from a normal distribution, before going through a series of transformations that turn
it into something plausible (image, video, audio, etc.).

However, a simple [DCGAN](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.06434) doesn't let us control
the appearance (e.g. class) of the samples we're generating. For instance,
with a GAN that generates MNIST handwritten digits, a simple DCGAN wouldn't let us
choose the class of digits we're generating.
To be able to control what we generate, we need to _condition_ the GAN output
on a semantic input, such as the class of an image.

In this example, we'll build a **Conditional GAN** that can generate MNIST handwritten
digits conditioned on a given class. Such a model can have various useful applications:

* let's say you are dealing with an
[imbalanced image dataset](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/data-prep/construct/sampling-splitting/imbalanced-data),
and you'd like to gather more examples for the skewed class to balance the dataset.
Data collection can be a costly process on its own. You could instead train a Conditional GAN and use
it to generate novel images for the class that needs balancing.
* Since the generator learns to associate the generated samples with the class labels,
its representations can also be used for [other downstream tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1809.11096).

Following are the references used for developing this example:

* [Conditional Generative Adversarial Nets](https://arxiv.org/abs/1411.1784)
* [Lecture on Conditional Generation from Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/lecture/build-basic-generative-adversarial-networks-gans/conditional-generation-inputs-2OPrG)

If you need a refresher on GANs, you can refer to the "Generative adversarial networks"
section of
[this resource](https://livebook.manning.com/book/deep-learning-with-python-second-edition/chapter-12/r-3/232).

## Calculating the number of input channel for the generator and discriminator

In a regular (unconditional) GAN, we start by sampling noise (of some fixed
dimension) from a normal distribution. In our case, we also need to account
for the class labels. We will have to add the number of classes to
the input channels of the generator (noise input) as well as the discriminator
(generated image input).
