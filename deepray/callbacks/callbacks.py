def sync_to_numpy_or_python_type(tensors):
  """Syncs and converts a structure of `Tensor`s to `NumPy` arrays or Python
  scalar types.

  For each tensor, it calls `tensor.numpy()`. If the result is a scalar value,
  it converts it to a Python type, such as a float or int, by calling
  `result.item()`.

  Numpy scalars are converted, as Python types are often more convenient to
  deal with. This is especially useful for bfloat16 Numpy scalars, which don't
  support as many operations as other Numpy values.

  Async strategies (such as `TPUStrategy` and `ParameterServerStrategy`) are
  forced to
  sync during this process.

  Args:
    tensors: A structure of tensors.

  Returns:
    `tensors`, but scalar tensors are converted to Python types and non-scalar
    tensors are converted to Numpy arrays.
