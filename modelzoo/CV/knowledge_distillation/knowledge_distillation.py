## Introduction to Knowledge Distillation

Knowledge Distillation is a procedure for model
compression, in which a small (student) model is trained to match a large pre-trained
(teacher) model. Knowledge is transferred from the teacher model to the student
by minimizing a loss function, aimed at matching softened teacher logits as well as
ground-truth labels.

The logits are softened by applying a "temperature" scaling function in the softmax,
effectively smoothing out the probability distribution and revealing
inter-class relationships learned by the teacher.

## Construct `Distiller()` class

The custom `Distiller()` class, overrides the `Model` methods `train_step`, `test_step`,
and `compile()`. In order to use the distiller, we need:

- A trained teacher model
- A student model to train
- A student loss function on the difference between student predictions and ground-truth
- A distillation loss function, along with a `temperature`, on the difference between the
soft student predictions and the soft teacher labels
- An `alpha` factor to weight the student and distillation loss
- An optimizer for the student and (optional) metrics to evaluate performance

In the `train_step` method, we perform a forward pass of both the teacher and student,
calculate the loss with weighting of the `student_loss` and `distillation_loss` by `alpha` and
`1 - alpha`, respectively, and perform the backward pass. Note: only the student weights are updated,
and therefore we only calculate the gradients for the student weights.

In the `test_step` method, we evaluate the student model on the provided dataset.

If the teacher is trained for 5 full epochs and the student is distilled on this teacher
for 3 full epochs, you should in this example experience a performance boost compared to
training the same student model from scratch, and even compared to the teacher itself.

scratch should be around 97.6%, and the distilled student should be around 98.1%. Remove
or try out different seeds to use different weight initializations.
